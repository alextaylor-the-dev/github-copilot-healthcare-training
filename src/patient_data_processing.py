# Sample Python script for healthcare data processing

import pandas as pd

# Load patient data from a CSV file
# Tip: You can ask GitHub Copilot to suggest how to load data from different file formats
patient_data = pd.read_csv('patient_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataframe
# Tip: Use GitHub Copilot to suggest different ways to explore the dataframe
print(patient_data.head())

# Clean the data by removing rows with missing values
# Tip: Ask GitHub Copilot for different data cleaning techniques
cleaned_data = patient_data.dropna()

# Calculate basic statistics
# Tip: GitHub Copilot can help you calculate various statistics
mean_age = cleaned_data['age'].mean()
print(f"Mean age of patients: {mean_age}")

# Group data by a specific column and calculate aggregate statistics
# Tip: Use GitHub Copilot to explore different aggregation methods
grouped_data = cleaned_data.groupby('diagnosis').mean()
print(grouped_data)

# Save the cleaned and processed data to a new CSV file
# Tip: Ask GitHub Copilot for suggestions on saving data to different formats
cleaned_data.to_csv('cleaned_patient_data.csv', index=False)

# Example of prompting GitHub Copilot for more advanced techniques:
# - How to handle large datasets
# - How to visualize data
# - How to integrate with cloud services like GitHub

# To explore more prompting techniques, you can:
# 1. Start typing a comment or code snippet and see what GitHub Copilot suggests.
# 2. Use the GitHub Copilot extension in your IDE to get real-time suggestions.
# 3. Refer to the GitHub Copilot documentation for more examples and best practices.

# This script is a basic example. Depending on your needs, you can expand it with more complex data processing and analysis techniques.# Sample Python script for healthcare data processing
